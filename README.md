Getting Started (Quick Guide)

Click the link I sent you - It will open TalkWorld and automatically connect to me
Set YOUR language - This is the language YOU want to write and read in
Confirm MY language - Make sure it's set to the language I actually speak
Start chatting - Type in your language, I'll see it in mine!

Setting Up Languages (Most Important Step!)
Step 1: Set YOUR Language

Click the ≡ menu button (top left)
Find the "Language" section
Under "Your Language" select the language YOU want to use
This is the language you'll type in and see my messages translated to

Step 2: Verify MY Language

In the same sidebar, find "Contacts"
My contact should be listed there
Make sure my language is set correctly
This ensures your messages are translated to the language I understand

Language Tips:

If I speak English, set my contact's language to "English"
If you speak Spanish, set YOUR language to "Spanish"
This way: You type in Spanish → I see English
I type in English → You see Spanish
We each type in our own language!

Using the Chat

Type your message in YOUR language
Press the send button (➤) or hit Enter
I'll see your message in MY language
You'll see the original message you typed below the translation
For voice messages, tap the microphone icon and speak in your language

Troubleshooting

If messages aren't translating correctly, double-check both language settings
If you disconnect, just click the link again
If the app freezes, refresh the page
